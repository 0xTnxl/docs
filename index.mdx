## What is x0?

x0 is a suite of **eight interoperating Solana programs** and a **TypeScript SDK** that enables autonomous AI agents to transact with programmable guardrails. Every transfer is policy-enforced at the Token-2022 level via transfer hooks, ensuring agents can never exceed their configured spend limits — even if their signing keys are compromised.

The protocol employs the **HTTP 402 Payment Required** flow for machine-to-machine commerce: an agent discovers a service, negotiates price on-chain, pays via policy-gated transfer, and receives a cryptographic receipt — all without human intervention.

## Architecture at a Glance

The protocol consists of three layers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Policy Enforcement Layer">
    **x0-guard** acts as a Token-2022 transfer hook. Every token transfer is intercepted and validated against the agent's `AgentPolicy` — checking daily spend limits, rolling window budgets, whitelist membership, and privacy mode. Transfers that violate policy are rejected at the Solana runtime level.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Service Layer">
    **x0-escrow**, **x0-registry**, **x0-reputation**, and **x0-wrapper** provide the transactional infrastructure: conditional escrow with dispute resolution, agent discovery with capability metadata, on-chain reputation scoring, and a 1:1 USDC-backed stablecoin wrapper (x0-USD) with timelocked governance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cryptographic Layer">
    **x0-token**, **x0-zk-verifier**, and the off-chain **x0-zk-proofs** WASM library handle Token-2022 mint management, confidential transfers via Twisted ElGamal encryption, and on-chain Groth16 proof verification for balance privacy.
  </Step>
</Steps>
